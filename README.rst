===================
Satellite Placement
===================
Suppose you have a set of ``N`` satellites and ``k`` targets on Earth that you
want to observe. Each of your satellites has varying capabilities for Earth
observation; in particular, the amount of ground that they can observe for a
set amount of time is different. Since there are ``k`` targets, you would like
to have ``k`` constellations to monitor said targets. How do you group your
satellites into ``k`` constellations such that the average coverage of each
constellation is maximized? This is the question that we will be addressing in
this demo!

There are two versions available. The first version has ``N=12`` and ``k=4``.
The larger version has ``N=39`` and ``k=13``.

Note: in this demo we are assuming that ``N`` is a multiple of ``k``.

Usage
-----
To run the smaller demo, using D-Wave's Simulated Annealing package (Neal), run the command:
::

  python satellite.py small.json neal

To run the larger demo, using D-Wave's Hybrid Solver Service (HSS), run the command:
::

  python satellite.py large.json hss

It will print out a set of satellite constellations.

Code Overview
-------------
The idea is to consider all possible combinations of satellites, eliminate
constellations with particularly low coverage, and encourage the following type
of solutions:

* Constellations that have better coverage
* Satellites to only join *one* constellation
* A specific number of constellations in our final solution (i.e. encourage the
  solution to have ``k`` constellations)

Code Specifics
--------------

* The ``score_threshold`` - used to determine bad constellations - was
  assigned an arbitrarily picked number
* In the code, we add weights to each constellation such that we are favoring
  constellations with a high average coverage (aka high score). This is done
  with ``bqm.add_variable(frozenset(constellation), -score)``. Observe that we
  are using ``frozenset(constellation)`` as the variable rather than simply
  ``constellation`` as

  1. We need our variable to be a set (i.e. the order of the satellites in a
     constellation should not matter, ``{a, b, c} == {c, a, b}``). In addition,
     ``add_variable(..)`` needs its variables to be immutable, hence, we are
     using ``frozenset`` rather than simply ``set``.
  2. Since are there are more ways to form the set ``{a, b, c}``
     than the set ``{a, a, a} -> {a}``, the set
     ``{'a', 'b', 'c'}`` will accumulate a more negative score and thus be more
     likely to get selected. This is desired as we do not want duplicate items
     within our constellation. (Note: by "more ways to form the set", I am
     referring to how ``(b, c, a)`` and ``(a, c, b)`` are tuples that would
     map to the same set, where as ``(a, a, a)`` would be the only 3-tuple that
     would map to the set ``{a}``.)
